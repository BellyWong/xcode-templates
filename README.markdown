Second Gear Xcode Templates - A suite of template files used by Second Gear for creating Mac & iOS applications
=========================

* Created by [Justin Williams](http://www.secondgearsoftware.com)

What is this?
-------------------------

These are customized versions of the existing Xcode templates as well as few handcrafted ones that we use at Second Gear HQ when building applications for iOS.  They match our "unique" code organization style.  Maybe you'll find them useful too.

What's included
-------------------------

* NSObject subclass
* UITableViewCell subclass
* UIView subclass
* Objective-C protocol
* UITableViewController subclass
* UIViewController subclass
* OCUnit test case class
* GHUnit test case class

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To install the templates, place five enclosed template folders in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/File Templates/[YourGroupingName]`.    If this directory does not exist, you will have to create it. You can replace `YourGroupingName` with your own descriptive name for your custom templates (We use Second Gear).
